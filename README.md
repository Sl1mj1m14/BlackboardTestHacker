# Blackboard Test Hacker
## *Okay, so maybe it isn't really hacking...* ##

This is a program I wrote initially to simply run some subnetting calculations because I was too lazy to do math.
I then got much lazier and decided to just write code to do my homework for me.

This works by reading the source of a blackboard test, then parsing it to json, stripping the questions from the json,
and running the questions by a filter to generate answers. The answers are output in javascript so they can be pasted
directly into the console log for the blackboard test page and ran.
